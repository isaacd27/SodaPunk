view cone is used to view the cone, in addition to the field of view editor, the field of view editor doesn't have to be attached to anything, however.
Test cone is important, it is used to find the Object with the highest priority.
note that test cone only sees things with the Object script attached.
Enemy controller controls what the enemy is currently doing, is meant to be a script that I can change to be inheritable later
